# IMPORTANT: These credentials are used by the server to send the saved PNG 
# to your cPanel server's /archive/ folder via FTP, SFTP, or an API endpoint.

# OPTION 1: Using a simple shared secret (API Key) if you set up a simple PHP/CGI endpoint on cPanel
# This is generally safer than storing full FTP credentials on the Render server.
